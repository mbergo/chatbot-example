To create a webpage in Flask with a chatbot using OpenAI and Langchain libraries, we will need several files. Here is the list of files we will need:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file.
2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for the webpage.
3. `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.
4. `chatbot.py`: This file contains the code for the chatbot using OpenAI and Langchain libraries.
5. `chroma_db.py`: This file contains the code for interacting with the Chroma vector database.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies:
